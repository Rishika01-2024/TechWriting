# Notepad++ : Magic of Ctrl+F and Find in Files

Have you ever had to sift through a massive collection of text or log files filled with data, only to find a specific piece of information? It can feel like searching for a needle in a haystack, right?

Well, donâ€™t worry! Whether youâ€™re a seasoned techie or a beginner, Notepad++ offers a simple solution to make this task much easier. Letâ€™s dive into how you can efficiently locate the data you need with just a few clicks!

## Taking a Use Case for Reference 

Letâ€™s assume you need to find the logs related to a specific employeeâ€™s hire feed, which has been sent from one system to another via an integration. For clarity, an integration refers to the transaction or data transfer between two or more systems.

Now, how can you quickly locate this particular log in a sea of data?

Below is an example of how Log files of an integration can look like -

2. Go to **Find in Files** and within **Find What** - type the specific employee code, employee ID, or any unique identifier related to the Hire feed you are looking for.

3. Within the **Directory** - select the folder where all the log files are stored. You can choose a specific folder or choose the root directory to search through all subfolders.

5. This will give you the below result. The **Find All** function will help you find the Hire feed of the employee with the specific employee code within all the log files present inside the log folder. In the below example it found the record of the employee with employee code ***71021357*** inside the ***Docs*** folder.

**Double click** on the data **under the search result** and Notepad++ will open the file containing the data and highlight it for you.

Now that youâ€™ve located the required data within the system, you can breathe a sigh of relief! No more wasting time opening each individual log fileâ€”Notepad++ has helped you efficiently pinpoint the desired information without the hassle.

>ðŸ’¡Bonus tip:
If you already know which file contains the data youâ€™re looking for, but the file is too large to manually search through, Ctrl+F in Notepad++ can help you quickly locate the information. Simply open the file in Notepad++, press Ctrl+F, enter the data you want to find in the **Find** field, and click **Find Next** or **Find All in Current Document**. This will help you pinpoint the exact data you need without sifting through the entire file.
